======================
Further configurations
======================

After you've installed the app and made an entry in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` of your project settings, there are things that you still need to know about.

If you are planning to handle things over AJAX, make sure you run this command before starting to hack the app::

    $ python manage.py collectstatic

This will copy ``notifyX.js`` and ``notifyX.min.js`` to your static root directory.

The ``notifyX.js`` file handles all the AJAX related actions ranging from marking notifications as read/unread to fetching new notifications and updating the notification box.

Now, include the ``notifyX.js`` static file in your base template.::

    {% load static %}
    ....
    <script src="{% static "notify/notifyX.js" %}"></script>
    <!-- OR -->
    <script src="{% static "notify/notifyX.min.js" %}"></script>


.. note::
    The other file, ``notifyX.min.js`` is a minified version of ``notifyX.js``. It is intended work the same as the original file. The advantage of a minified javascript file is that it removes unnecessary things and ultimately reduces the size of the final file with same functionality.

.. warning::
    Make sure you include ``notifyX.js`` after you've included latest JQuery javascript file. This script uses JQuery to handle AJAX calls and DOM manipulation. It will break if JQuery is not included before it.
